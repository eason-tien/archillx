# ArcHillx Gate Summary Dashboard

This dashboard summarizes **release gate** and **rollback gate** evidence generated by:

- `scripts/release_check.py`
- `scripts/rollback_check.py`

## Generated outputs

Run:

```bash
./scripts/gate_summary.sh --limit 20
```

It generates three artifacts under `evidence/dashboards/`:

- `gate_summary_*.json`
- `gate_summary_*.md`
- `gate_summary_*.html`

## What the dashboard shows

### Release gate
- recent release gate runs
- pass / fail counts
- pass rate
- most common failed checks
- recent evidence files

### Rollback gate
- recent rollback gate runs
- pass / fail counts
- pass rate
- most common failed checks
- recent evidence files

## Suggested operator usage

### Before deployment
1. run `./scripts/release_check.sh --mode deploy --env-file .env.prod`
2. generate gate summary
3. confirm that recent release gate pass rate is stable
4. confirm there is at least one valid rollback evidence report and recent backup verification

### Before rollback exercise
1. run `./scripts/rollback_check.sh --mode deploy --env-file .env.prod --backup-archive <file>`
2. generate gate summary
3. check top rollback failures
4. verify restore drill evidence exists

## Reading the panels

### Pass rate trend
If pass rate drops sharply, inspect the latest failed evidence first.

### Most common failures
These help identify recurring release blockers, for example:
- `migration_state`
- `backup_archive_verify`
- `docker_compose_config`
- `sandbox_image_present`

### Recent runs
Use the evidence paths shown in the dashboard to open the original JSON reports.
